# Home Safe React Native App

## I debated between building my server-side capstone as a native mobile app with React Native and a mobile-friendly web app.
I decided to go with a mobile-friendly web app (for now), but eventually I plan to convert it to React Native. I'll be gradually adopting new features in this repo. You can view the full web app [here](https://github.com/jordan-castelloe/home-safe).
